Please answer in a concise manner with all the details from the provided context. If you don't have enough information, just say "I don't know" ."""

Answer :

Model answer (Cypher query used for the database): MATCH (room)-[:CONTAINS]->(door)
WHERE door.ifcType = 'IfcDoor'
RETURN 
  room.ifcType AS roomType,
  room.name AS roomName,
  door.ifcId AS doorId,
  door.name AS doorName,
  door.position_x,
  door.position_y,
  door.position_z
connection to database established
Final answer: The nearest door to the position [12.34, 56.78, 9.1] is the door with the ID '1hOSvn6df7F8_7GcBWlRGQ', which is located at the coordinates [8.628, -16.178, 1.0202] in the BIM model.
